### Airnote ###

##### Description

<dl>
  <dd>This is an android application made with Phonegap, compiled in Android Studio. Airnote is an application that allows users to leave messages on their location. Other users and themselves can see these notes utilising the camera on the phone and look around. Notes will pop up on the screen using augmented reality. You could write something on the bathroom wall, you could write down memories in a classroom for others to see.</dd>
</dl>

##### How To Install

<dl>
  <dd>Download the Airnote project. Use Android Studio (or tools alike) to compile the project you have imported, to your phone. I tested the application on a Samsung Galaxy S4.

  Go to tommoore.be to find this project in my portfolio to see how it works.

### Automatic Translate Chat ###

##### Description

<dl>
  <dd>ELA is a chat appliction that allows people to chat with each other in their own language. When posting a message to the group chat, users will receive the message in their own language. You can choose your language in the settings or let it be determined automatically through recognition. In this example, I am using the Microsoft Bing Translator because it is free. Every translation tool can be implemented.</dd>

### Impulsave ###

##### Description

  <dd>This project was made with an awesome 4 person team. Me, William, Thaïs and Laetitia are students at Thomas More University College. We participated in a Hackaton organized by ING Belgium. We made an application with PHP, using IBM BlueMix to connect to a cloud database. The application allows users to save money on the go. By not buying a certain item, you can condition yourself to save the money instead. This application uses the ING API to switch money from one account to another.</dd>

### Rentro Facebook 90s Website ###

##### Description

<dl>
  <dd>This is a small project made with Node.js. I made it because it was really fun for me to make. I love messing around with application ideas. Basically I made a Social Media, with only the option to have posts on your profile. I themed it with a 90s web design. This project is nothing special, I just think it looks funny.</dd>
